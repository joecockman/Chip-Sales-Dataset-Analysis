# Quantium-Virtual-Internship-Chip-Sales-Dataset-Analysis

This was a project I completed as part of the Quantium virtual internship. The task was to clean and then analyse a dataset containing a year of sales data for a company selling chips. 

I used python to complete this project, utlising the pandas library for analysis and the matplotlib library for visualisations.

My work can be found in the file repository in both ipynb form and PDF form. the dataset can also be found there.
